MKFST (Make Fast) is a high-performance, async, non-ASGI, Python HTTP webserver framework. It's designed to bridge the gap between software like LinkerD and your traditional web framework, offering features like rate limiting, circuit breaking, built-in request-level compression or decompression, AESGCM256 request and response encryption, and more.

MKFST also supports FastAPI-like automatic OpenAPI 3.1 spec endpont documentation out of the box, a powerful asynchronous task system to help you run work you'd normally defer to runners like Celery, and even Snowflake ID generation so you can realize all your distributed web needs.
